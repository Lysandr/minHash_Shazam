# minHash_Shazam
This is a version of the Shazam song matching algorithm using the minHash randomized hashing algorithm. Samuel Watson Wishnek and Padraig Lysandrou wrote this as a final project from The University of Colorado Boulder's APPM5720: Randomized Algorithms course taught by Professor Stephen Becker.

To run test the algorithm on songs, run the wrapper.m file. It will search songs in the songDatabase folder. Make testOption = 1 to regenerate the hash table.
